    <h6>In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum (/ˌlɔː.rəm ˈɪp.səm/) is a placeholder
         text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. 
        Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is available.
         It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a 
         webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design.

        Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman 
        statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical
         and improper Latin. The first two words themselves are a truncation of dolorem ipsum ("pain itself").</h6>
